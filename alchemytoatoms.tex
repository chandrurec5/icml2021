%%%%%%%% ICML 2021 EXAMPLE LATEX SUBMISSION FILE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\documentclass{article}

% Recommended, but optional, packages for figures and better typesetting:
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{booktabs} % for professional tables

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2021} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2021} above.


% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
\usepackage{icml2021}
\usepackage{nidanfloat}
\usepackage{pifont}
\input{pack}
% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
%\usepackage[accepted]{icml2021}```

% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.
% Therefore, a short form for the running title is supplied here:
\icmltitlerunning{Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2021}

\icmltitle{Duality Simplifies The Neural Tangent Kernel: From Alchemy To Atoms}

% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2021
% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% This command actually creates the footnote in the first column
% listing the affiliations and the copyright notice.
% The command takes one argument, which is text to display at the start of the footnote.
% The \icmlEqualContribution command is standard text for equal contribution.
% Remove it (just {}) if you do not need this facility.

%\printAffiliationsAndNotice{}  % leave blank if no need to mention equal contribution
\printAffiliationsAndNotice{\icmlEqualContribution} % otherwise use the standard text.
